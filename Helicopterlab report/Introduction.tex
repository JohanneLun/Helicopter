\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Introduction}
The purpose of this assignment was to find a model for a given system so that the system can be controlled. To do this we had to derive and apply PD and multivariable controllers in real time, and demonstrate how we could estimate states that could not be directly measured. We also had to develop a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) for the system.
\newline\newline
The system was a helicopter mounted on a table. It consisted of a base on which a long arm with a counterweight on one side and two propellers on the other side (see \cref{fig:helic_model}). We used the two propellers to control all of the joints of the system.
\newline\newline
This report is organized as follows: \Cref{sec:part1} contains the mathematical modelling of the system which is part I of the assignment, \cref{sec:part2} contains part II about the monovariable control, \cref{sec:part3} contains part III about the multivariable control of the system, and last \cref{sec:part4} contains the state estimation in part IV. In addition to this the Appendix contains \cref{sec:matlab_code}, the Matlab code, \cref{sec:simulink_diagrams} , the Simulink diagrams used in our models and control and References contains all bibliography we have used during our work with this assignment.
